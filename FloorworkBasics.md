## Floorwork Basics ##
  * The shaded area on this diagram represents a walking band which is always wide enough for two Officers to walk side by side
  * All Officers' movements about the Chapter room are directed by the letters on the diagram
  * X is the station of the Officer(s) being directed.
  * Z is the point on the walking band nearest the station of the Officer(s) being directed.
  * An Officer directed to move X Z moves directly forward from his station to the walking band, except the Councilors, Scribe and Treasurer will move by the most direct route to the walking band, but around the pedestals or desks in their paths.
  * An Officer directed to move Z X returns to his station by retracing his X Z route.
